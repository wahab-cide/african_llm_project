# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ addresses common questions and issues encountered when working with the African LLM project.

## General Questions

### Q: What is the goal of this project?

### Q: Why focus on African languages?

**A**: African languages are significantly underrepresented in NLP research despite being spoken by hundreds of millions of people. This project contributes to:
- Digital inclusion for African language speakers
- Preservation of linguistic diversity
- Development of language technologies for African communities
- Research opportunities in multilingual NLP

### Q: What makes this project different from other multilingual models?

**A**: This project is specifically designed for African languages with:
- Shared vocabulary optimized for African language families
- Data collection from African-specific sources
- Community-driven development approach
- Focus on practical applications for African contexts

## Technical Questions

### Q: What hardware do I need to run this project?

**A**: 
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, CPU-only training
- **Recommended**: 32GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM
- **Optimal**: Multi-GPU setup for faster training

### Q: Can I run this on Apple Silicon (M1/M2)?

**A**: Yes! The project supports Apple Silicon through PyTorch's MPS backend. Just make sure to:
- Use PyTorch 2.0+ with MPS support
- Disable fp16 in training config (set `fp16: false`)
- Monitor memory usage as MPS has different memory management

### Q: How long does training take?

**A**: Training time varies significantly:
- **Small model** (6 layers, small dataset): 2-4 hours
- **Medium model** (12 layers, full dataset): 8-24 hours
- **Large model** (24+ layers): Days to weeks

### Q: What's the difference between the datasets?

**A**: 
- `tokenized_dataset`: Full dataset with all available data
- `tokenized_dataset_small`: Limited to 50,000 examples per language for faster iteration

## Data Questions

### Q: Where does the training data come from?

**A**: Data sources include:
- **OSCAR**: Open Super-large Crawled Aggregated coRpus
- **CC-100**: Common Crawl 100 dataset

### Q: How is the data quality ensured?

**A**: The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Language detection and filtering
- Text normalization and cleaning
- Duplicate removal
- Length filtering
- Quality checks

### Q: Can I add my own data?

**A**: Yes! You can add custom data by:
1. Placing text files in `data/raw/`
2. Running the preprocessing pipeline
3. Retraining the tokenizer if needed
4. Rebuilding the tokenized dataset

### Q: How much data is available for each language?

**A**: Approximate sizes:
- Amharic: 200MB+
- Fulani: 10MB+
- Hausa: 100MB+
- Somali: 100MB+
- Swahili: 8MB+
- Yoruba: 26MB+

## Training Questions

### Q: How do I start training?

**A**: 
1. Follow the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md)
2. Download and process data
3. Run: `python training/scripts/train.py`

### Q: What if I run out of GPU memory?

**A**: Try these solutions:
- Reduce batch size in config
- Increase gradient accumulation steps
- Enable gradient checkpointing
- Use a smaller model size
- Use mixed precision (fp16) if supported

### Q: How do I monitor training progress?

**A**: 
- **Weights & Biases**: Automatic logging to W&B dashboard
- **TensorBoard**: Local metrics at `outputs/logs/`
- **Console**: Real-time progress updates
- **GPU monitoring**: `nvidia-smi -l 1`

### Q: Can I resume training from a checkpoint?

**A**: Yes! Use:
```bash
python training/scripts/train.py --resume_from_checkpoint outputs/models/checkpoint-1000
```

### Q: What's the best learning rate?

**A**: Start with the default (5e-5) and adjust based on:
- If loss doesn't decrease: try lower (1e-5)
- If loss is unstable: try lower (1e-5)
- If training is too slow: try higher (1e-4)

## Model Questions

### Q: What model architecture is used?

**A**: The project uses GPT-2 architecture with:
- Shared vocabulary across all languages
- Configurable model sizes (6-24 layers)
- Optimized for multilingual training

### Q: How do I evaluate the model?

**A**: 
- **Automatic**: Training includes validation metrics
- **Manual**: Use evaluation scripts in `evaluation/`
- **Generation**: Test text generation capabilities

### Q: Can I use the trained model for inference?

**A**: Yes! The model can be used for:

### Q: How do I export the model?

**A**: 
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("outputs/models/final")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("outputs/models/final")

model.save_pretrained("deployment/model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("deployment/model")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I get "CUDA out of memory" errors

**A**: 
1. Reduce batch size in training config
